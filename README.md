# ✨ Lisa Liu's Little Universe on the Internet ✨

**>> LIVE at:** [lisaliu060306-art.github.io/lisaliuofficialwebsite/](https://lisaliu060306-art.github.io/lisaliuofficialwebsite/)

Hey there! Welcome to my digital corner of the internet! If my website was a room, this README would be the fun little sign on the door. Come on in and look around! 🚀

## 🌟 Who's This Lisa Person Anyway?

I'm a **Cal '29** undergrad student (go Bears! 🐻) majoring in **Applied Math & Physics**, while also geeking out over **Data Science** and **Education**. Basically, I love building bridges between things that don't usually talk to each other—like complex systems and visual storytelling.

## 🎨 What You'll Find on My Site

My website is my cozy digital home where I get to show off all the random, wonderful things I'm obsessed with:

- **📚 My Academic Playground:** All the cool stuff I'm studying—-Linear Algebra, Mechanics, E&M and more!

- **🎼 My Creative Escape:** My world of music， visual art, writing (travel diaries & poetry), and even film (I *love* making cinematic fan art).

- **🔧 How It's Built:** 
  - 🏗️ Structure:HTML5
  - 🎨 Style & Vibe: Pure CSS3 (gotta make it look pretty!)
  - ✨ Sparkle: A sprinkle of JavaScript

## 🗺️ What's Next for This Little Universe?

I'm always tinkering! Future plans include:

- Adding a **dark mode toggle** (for my fellow night owls 🦉)
- Adding more **interactive art and music snippets**
- Generally making this place even more *me*
